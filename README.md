# CeloHT DAO Layer

CeloHT DAO Layer is the decentralized governance core of the CeloHT ecosystem.
It enables the community to create proposals, vote, and execute actions through a secure, transparent, on-chain and off-chain governance system.

## About CeloHT
CeloHT is a **community-driven decentralized ecosystem** built on Celo.
It is **not a token**. CeloHT focuses on impactful initiatives across three core pillars:
1. **Education**  financial literacy, training, and blockchain knowledge.
2. **Agents**  local agents supporting users and Valora onboarding.
3. **Reforestation**  community-led tree-planting and micro-funding initiatives.

CeloHT uses:
- **cUSD** for treasury and operations
- **CELO** for gas and governance execution
- **Valora** to onboard users and process transactions

## Legal & Governance Note
- CeloHT is **not a security or tradable token**.
- Governance powers reside entirely with the **DAO and community members**.
- Founder role (Johnny Dubic) is limited to **strategic vision and proposal initiation**.
