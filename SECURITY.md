# CeloHT Security Policy

## Treasury Management
- All proposals that move funds **must be voted on and queued in a timelock** before execution.  
- The treasury is managed through a **Gnosis Safe multisig** (recommended 3/5 or 4/7 configuration).  
- No private admin keys or backdoors are allowed in any deployed contracts.

## Audits
- **Mandatory external audits** must be completed before deployment to mainnet.  
- Audits must cover smart contracts and financial logic and be performed by an **approved security auditor** recognized by the DAO.  
- Audit reports must be publicly available or submitted to the community before proposal execution.

## Responsible Disclosure & Bug Bounty
- Any security vulnerability must be reported to **security@celoht.org**(celoht3@gmail.com )(official email).  
- A **bug bounty program** will reward verified vulnerabilities according to DAO guidelines.  
- Reports are confidential until verified and addressed.  

## Compliance
- All security rules must be followed by contributors, stewards, and any third-party collaborators.  
- Violations or deviations from this policy require community review and corrective action before approval of related proposals.
